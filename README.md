## About Me

I am a software engineer specializing in backend development and distributed systems. My primary focus is on designing scalable, maintainable, and secure architectures that support high-performance applications. I have experience working with both monolithic and microservices-based systems, and I enjoy working across the stack when necessary.

### Technical Proficiencies

I primarily work with TypeScript and Go, and Iâ€™m comfortable with both SQL and NoSQL databases. I rely on tools like Git and Docker to build and manage reliable, containerized systems.

### Areas of Interest

- Distributed Systems & Event-Driven Architecture  
- Systems Design & Optimization  
- Software Engineering Best Practices

### Professional Objectives

- Continuously learn and apply modern engineering patterns
